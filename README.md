# Dynamic-UI-using-Service-API
Implementing UI for RESTful Service  
I have implemented an UI for RESTful Service with a dynamic approach that uses asynchronous JavaScript requests to send the user-inputted data to the ReST API you built, receive the structured results, and then publish them into the page without refreshing the whole page again.  
The Webpage takes an input date and then plot the Forecasts TMIN, TMAX for Next Five Days.  
I also ploted weather forecast for 5 DAYS from a Third Party Weather Forecasting Service.  
When you click the link http://ec2-18-218-142-90.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:5000/web/ , you will be getting an webpage with a date selection option. When you choose the date and click the button, you will get a graph of TMAX and TMIN for next 5 days. This is done by using AJAX.
